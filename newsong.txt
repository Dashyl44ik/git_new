At first I was afraid, I was petrified!
Kept thinkinâ€™ I could never live
without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong,
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along.
And so you're back from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with
that sad look upon your face
I shoulda changed that stupid lock,
I shoulda made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me.
